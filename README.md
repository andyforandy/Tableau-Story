# Tableau-Story

Project Overview
For this project, you will create a data visualization using Tableau that tells a story or highlights trends or patterns in a data set. Your work should be a reflection of the theory and practice of data visualization, such as visual encodings, design principles, and effective communication.

What do I need to install?
Before working on the project, you will need to have either Tableau Public or Tableau Desktop installed. You will need a software license to use Tableau Desktop. If you don't have one, you can download Tableau Public HERE.

Why this Project?
This project will touch on the overarching attitudes and beliefs important to effective data visualization, such as:

visualization is a dialog
showcasing and sharing visualizations with others
visualization is a fluid process that typically requires multiple iterations of improvements
You will have an opportunity to experience the end-to-end process of creating effective data visualizations and highlighting important information from data that may otherwise be hidden or hard to uncover.

What will I learn?
After completing the project, you will be able to:

Demonstrate the ability to choose optimal visual elements to encode data and critically assess the effectiveness of a visualization
Communicate a story or finding to the appropriate audience using interactive visualizations
Undergo the iterative process of creating a visualization, and build interactive visualizations with Tableau
